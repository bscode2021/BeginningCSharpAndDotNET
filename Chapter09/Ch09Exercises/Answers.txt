9.1 What is wrong with the following code?
public sealed class MyClass
{
    // Class members.
}
public class myDerivedClass : MyClass
{
    // Class members.
}
Answer:
'Program.myDerivedClass': cannot derive from sealed type 'Program.MyClass'

9.2 How would you define a noncreatable class?
Answer:
A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, 
but there is one difference: a static class cannot be instantiated. 
In other words, you cannot use the new operator to create a variable of the class type.
    
In summary, static classes can neither support instantiation nor inheritance. 
This makes them ideal for use in utility classes that do not need further modifications. 
On the other hand, if we need to add functionalities to our classes, 
non-static classes would be more ideal than their static counterparts.
